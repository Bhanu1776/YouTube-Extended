## Features that Set Youtube-Extended Apart ✨

📍 The finest alternative to YouTube built on `Config Driven UI`!  
📍 You can't dare to move your eyes back in `Aesthetic Dark mode`.  
📍 Improved UX by implementing `Shimmer UI`.  
📍 Seamlessly integrated the `YouTube API` to offer you access to an extensive library of videos.  
📍 Thanks to `React Query`, it elevated performance by caching network calls. Say goodbye to sluggish loading!  
📍 Search feature is lightning-fast, thanks to `debouncing` and `caching`. Find your favorite videos in the blink of an eye.  
📍 Utilizing Api polling, a `live chat` functionality is developed.  
📍 Awesome `Nested comments` using recursion just like Reddit  
📍 Although it's a Dynamic, Highly Scalable and Industry Level Application.
